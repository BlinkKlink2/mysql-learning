Comparision & Logical Operators
--------------------------------

>not equal (!=)
/Note#/ Technically '=' and '!=' are comparision operators not logical operators. 

>not like

> greater than (>)
/Note#/ select 80 > 40; it will return 1 (true). 
/Note#/ select 80 > 100; it will return 0 (false).
/Note#/ select 1 > NULL; it will return NULL.

> greater than equal to (>=) 

> less than or equal to (<=)

> Logical AND
ex: select title, author_lname, released_year from books where released_year > 2010 and
    author_lname='Eggers';

> Logical OR

> Logical BETWEEN
select title from books between 2004 and 2005; //both inclusive

> Logical NOT BETWEEN
